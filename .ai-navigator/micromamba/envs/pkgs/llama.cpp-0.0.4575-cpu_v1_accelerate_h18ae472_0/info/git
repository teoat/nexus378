commit d35af7061378fbebeb678bc1df8722cb1220bcc9

    fix convert_lora_to_gguf.py
    
    convert_lora_to_gguf.py uses relative, unqualified imports that fail when the tools/scripts
    are correctly packaged and namespaced. Additionally, there is no main definition to run the script,
    and the logic is contained in the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block breaking the entry point
    definitions.
    
    This patch can be dropped if/when the upstream repo is refactored to follow python package conventions
    and the import statement and `if __name__ == '__main__':` block are updated to follow best practices.
