# Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a simple web application. The application will have a frontend, a backend, and a database. It will serve as a basic template for future projects.

# Core Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out.
- **API**: A backend API to provide data to the frontend.
- **Frontend**: A simple UI to display data from the API.

# Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

# Development Roadmap
- **Phase 1: Backend Setup**:
  - Initialize Node.js project.
  - Set up Express server.
  - Design and create database schema.
  - Implement user authentication endpoints.
  - Create API endpoints for data.
- **Phase 2: Frontend Setup**:
  - Initialize React project.
  - Create basic UI components.
  - Set up routing.
- **Phase 3: Integration**:
  - Connect frontend to backend API.
  - Implement login and registration forms.
  - Display data from the API on the frontend.

# Logical Dependency Chain
1.  Database schema design.
2.  Backend API development, including authentication.
3.  Frontend UI development.
4.  Integration of frontend and backend.

# Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Scope creep.
- **Mitigation**: Stick to the defined features for the initial version.
