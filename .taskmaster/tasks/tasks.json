This includes building reusable navigation components (e.g., bottom tab bar, side drawer) and integrating them across all screens, ensuring adherence to the consistency guidelines from Task #63. A key part of this task is to develop and integrate a global search feature, accessible from the primary navigation, which allows users to find features, settings, and content quickly. Implement analytics hooks to track user interaction with the new navigation and search functionality.",
        "testStrategy": "Write E2E tests using the framework from Task #42 to cover critical user flows through the new navigation paths. Manually test all navigation links and search functionality across various device sizes. Conduct usability testing on a staging build with a small user group to gather qualitative feedback on the new layout's intuitiveness. After deployment, monitor analytics to measure changes in feature adoption rates, time-on-task for key workflows, and usage of the new search feature to validate success.",
