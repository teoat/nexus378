SPEC-1-ForensicApp

Background

This application is a comprehensive, AI-powered Forensic Analysis Platform engineered to streamline, enhance, and partially automate the complex process of financial investigation. It brings together a modern, interactive frontend UI; a secure and modular backend-for-frontend (BFF) Node.js gateway; and a powerful Python-based AI service. Together, these components create a holistic ecosystem capable of supporting fraud detection, discrepancy resolution, multi-party case management, and automated analysis reporting.

The platform is designed to be extensible and future-proof. It integrates cutting-edge AI technologies like LangGraph and LangChain for agentic reasoning, a vector search-enabled help system, and infrastructure-level resilience through event queues and real-time streams. The platform not only accelerates investigations but also improves accuracy and consistency across large teams and datasets.

Requirements

Must Have:

M: React + Next.js frontend with SSR, data visualization, drag-drop upload, and contextual workflows.

M: Node.js (NestJS) API Gateway providing REST and GraphQL endpoints, session management, and secure access to backend services.

M: FastAPI-based Python AI microservice running LangGraph agents to analyze financial data and detect anomalies.

M: Database layer combining PostgreSQL (structured), Neo4j (relational/graph), and Redis (caching/session).

M: Communication layer using gRPC for synchronous tasks and RabbitMQ for asynchronous task distribution.

M: Persistent WebSocket connections from client to gateway for live updates and notifications.

M: Testing framework that enforces determinism, runs in CI/CD, and targets #95% test coverage at all layers.

Should Have:

S: Visualization components including table virtualization, graph-based entity maps, and live KPI widgets.

S: File ingestion module with secure presigned S3 uploads, schema detection, and configurable mapping tools.

S: Column-mapping interface for reconciling user-uploaded financial datasets with internal schema.

S: Fraud detection module powered by custom rules, ML scoring, and explainability layers.

S: Error-handling framework with component-level error boundaries and structured API failure feedback.

Could Have:

C: Visual regression testing suite that integrates Storybook and Chromatic.

C: Multi-language support through i18n-ready architecture (e.g., react-i18next).

C: Gateway-level caching using Redis to minimize DB and compute usage on repeated frontend requests.

Won't Have (initially):

W: Native iOS or Android mobile app.

W: Direct frontend access to any persistence or AI layer â€” all communication is brokered via the Gateway.

Method

We are building the system as a set of interoperable, containerized services using a modular microservices strategy. Each service is clearly bounded, type-safe, and testable in isolation.

Implementation

Frontend (Next.js + React)

Create atomic component library using Tailwind, ShadCN, and Storybook.

Develop core workflows: case lifecycle, ingestion UI, entity graphs, and discrepancy editor.

Integrate real-time help overlays, chat window, and proactive UI suggestions.

Node.js Gateway (NestJS)

Implement structured modules with gRPC and REST interfaces.

Introduce RBAC-based auth guards.

Implement WebSocket modules for job progress, alerts, dashboard metrics.

Connect PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and Neo4j clients.

Python AI Service (FastAPI)
