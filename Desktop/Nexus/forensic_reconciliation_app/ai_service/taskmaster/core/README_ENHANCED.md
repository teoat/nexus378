## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- SQLite3 (usually included with Python)

### Quick Start
1. **Clone or download** the files to your project directory
2. **Run the basic demo** to test the system:
   ```bash
   python enhanced_demo.py
   ```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Task Management

```python
from unified_task_system import UnifiedTaskSystem

# Create system
system = UnifiedTaskSystem()

# Add a simple TODO
todo_id = system.add_new_todo(
    name="API Implementation",
    description="Build REST API endpoints",
    priority="HIGH",
    estimated_duration="8-12 hours",
    required_capabilities=["python", "flask", "api_design"]
)

# Register a worker
system.register_worker("worker_001", "Backend Developer", ["python", "flask", "api_design"])

# Worker claims and completes task
system.claim_task("worker_001", todo_id)
system.update_task_progress("worker_001", todo_id, 50.0, "API endpoints implemented")
system.complete_task("worker_001", todo_id, "API fully implemented and tested")
```

### 2. Task Breakdown

```python
from task_breakdown import TaskBreakdownEngine

engine = TaskBreakdownEngine()

# Analyze task complexity
complexity = engine.analyze_task_complexity("40-50 hours")
print(f"Complexity: {complexity.value}")  # Output: epic

# Check if breakdown needed
needs_breakdown = engine.should_breakdown_task("40-50 hours")
print(f"Breakdown needed: {needs_breakdown}")  # Output: True

# Generate subtasks
subtasks = engine.breakdown_task(
    "Full-Stack E-commerce Platform",
    "Build complete e-commerce platform",
    "40-50 hours",
    ["nodejs", "react", "postgresql"]
)

for subtask in subtasks:
    print(f"- {subtask['name']}: {subtask['estimated_duration']}")
```

### 3. Parallel Worker System

```python
from parallel_worker_system import ParallelWorkerSystem

# Create parallel system
system = ParallelWorkerSystem()

# Add complex tasks
epic_todo = system.main_system.add_new_todo(
    name="Enterprise Data Platform",
    description="Build comprehensive data platform",
    priority="CRITICAL",
    estimated_duration="60-80 hours",
    required_capabilities=["python", "postgresql", "docker", "kubernetes"]
)

# Start worker processes
system.start_worker_process("worker_001", "Frontend Developer", ["react", "typescript"])
system.start_worker_process("worker_002", "Backend Developer", ["nodejs", "python"])
system.start_worker_process("worker_003", "DevOps Engineer", ["docker", "kubernetes"])

# Check system status
status = system.get_system_status()
print(f"Active workers: {status['active_worker_processes']}")
```

## 🖥️ Multi-Terminal Setup

### Terminal 1: Start Main System
```bash
cd forensic_reconciliation_app/ai_service/taskmaster/core
python parallel_worker_system.py --start-system
```

### Terminal 2: Frontend Worker
```bash
cd forensic_reconciliation_app/ai_service/taskmaster/core
python worker_client.py worker_001 "Frontend Developer" "react,typescript,ui_design"
```

### Terminal 3: Backend Worker
```bash
cd forensic_reconciliation_app/ai_service/taskmaster/core
python worker_client.py worker_002 "Backend Developer" "nodejs,python,postgresql"
```

### Terminal 4: DevOps Worker
```bash
cd forensic_reconciliation_app/ai_service/taskmaster/core
python worker_client.py worker_003 "DevOps Engineer" "docker,kubernetes,ci_cd"
```

## 🔧 Task Breakdown Patterns

The system automatically recognizes and breaks down common task types:

### API Development
- Requirements analysis
- API design
- Database schema
- Backend implementation
- Testing
- Documentation

### Frontend Development
- UI design
- Component development
- State management
- Routing
- Testing
- Optimization

### Database Work
- Schema design
- Table creation
- Indexing
- Migration scripts

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Encryption
- Audit logging
- Penetration testing

### DevOps Infrastructure
- Infrastructure design
- Container setup
- CI/CD pipeline
- Monitoring setup

## 📊 System Monitoring

### Check System Status
```bash
python parallel_worker_system.py --status
```

### Stop All Workers
```bash
python parallel_worker_system.py --stop-all
```

### Worker Performance Metrics
- Tasks completed
- Tasks failed
- Success rate
- Average completion time
- Last heartbeat

## 🔄 Continuous Work Loops

Workers automatically:
1. **Check for available tasks** based on their capabilities
2. **Claim tasks** when available
3. **Update progress** as they work
4. **Complete tasks** when finished
5. **Repeat** until no more tasks are available

The system ensures:
- **No duplicate work** through conflict detection
- **Proper task dependencies** are respected
- **Worker capabilities** match task requirements
- **Progress tracking** for all tasks and subtasks

## 🚨 Error Handling

### Worker Timeout
- Workers are monitored for heartbeats
- Timed-out workers are marked offline
- Their tasks are marked as failed
- System automatically recovers

### Task Conflicts
- Similar tasks are detected automatically
- Workers cannot claim conflicting tasks
- System prevents duplicate work

### Database Issues
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Graceful degradation
- Error logging and reporting

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Parallel Processing
- Multiple workers can work simultaneously
- Tasks are distributed based on capabilities
- No blocking between workers

### Smart Task Distribution
- Tasks are assigned based on worker capabilities
- Dependencies are respected
- Load balancing across workers

### Efficient Database Operations
- Connection pooling
- Batch operations
- Indexed queries

## 🧪 Testing & Development

### Run Demos
```bash
# Basic functionality demo
python unified_demo.py

# Enhanced features demo
python enhanced_demo.py
