# Product Requirements Document: UI/UX Redesign

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive redesign of the Nexus's user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). The primary goal is to create a more intuitive, modern, and efficient interface for forensic accountants, investigators, and legal professionals.

## 2. Goals

*   **Modernize the UI:** Update the visual design to be clean, modern, and professional.
*   **Improve Usability:** Streamline workflows and make the application easier to navigate.
*   **Enhance Data Visualization:** Create more powerful and interactive ways to visualize complex financial data.
*   **Improve Performance:** Ensure the UI is fast and responsive, even with large datasets.
*   **Increase Accessibility:** Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities.

## 3. Target Audience

*   Forensic Accountants
*   Financial Investigators
*   Litigation Support Professionals
*   Auditors

## 4. Brainstorming - Initial Ideas

*(This section will be expanded during our brainstorming session)*

### UI/UX Concepts:
- **Ingestion-First Workflow:** The first page after user authorization will be a dedicated data ingestion page. This page will allow users to upload various types of evidence, including:
  - Expenses journals (e.g., CSV, Excel)
  - Bank statements (e.g., CSV, PDF)
  - Other evidence files (e.g., PDFs, chat logs, images)
- **Visual Workflow Guidance:** The ingestion page will feature a visual guide, such as a sidebar or a floating element in the bottom-right corner, to inform users about the available workflows and next steps.
- **Dashboard-centric Design:** A central, customizable dashboard showing key metrics, recent cases, and alerts.
- **Unified Case View:** A single, comprehensive view for each case, integrating evidence, transactions, reports, and collaboration tools.
- **Visual Investigation Canvas:** A Miro-style infinite canvas for visually mapping out transaction flows, relationships, and evidence.
- **AI-Powered Assistance:** Integrate an AI assistant directly into the UI to help with data queries, anomaly detection, and report generation.

### Technology Stack Ideas:
- **Frontend Framework:** Evaluate modern frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte for building a more dynamic and responsive UI.
- **Charting Libraries:** Explore advanced charting libraries like D3.js, ECharts, or Highcharts for creating powerful data visualizations.
- **Component Library:** Consider using a component library like Material-UI, Ant Design, or a custom-built library to ensure design consistency.

## 5. Next Steps

-   Flesh out the brainstorming section with more detailed ideas.
-   Create low-fidelity wireframes for key screens.
-   Develop high-fidelity mockups and prototypes.
-   Gather feedback from target users.
-   Create a detailed implementation plan.
