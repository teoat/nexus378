## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Basic agent health
2. **Test thoroughly** before moving to next phase
3. **Keep it simple** - avoid over-engineering
4. **Focus on working features** rather than perfect code
5. **Document as you go** - don't leave it until the end

This simplified approach breaks down the complex synchronization into manageable, testable pieces that can be implemented incrementally.

## 🎯 **Key Implementation Principles**

### **Simplicity First**
- Start with the simplest possible implementation
- Add complexity only when needed
- Use existing libraries and tools when possible

### **Test-Driven Development**
- Write tests before implementing features
- Test each component in isolation
- Validate integration points thoroughly

### **Incremental Progress**
- Complete one small feature before starting the next
- Celebrate small wins to maintain momentum
- Document lessons learned for future phases

### **User Experience Focus**
- Consider how each feature affects the end user
- Prioritize features that provide immediate value
- Design for both technical and non-technical users
