## 📋 **Phase 6: Error Handling (Week 6)**

### **6.1 Basic Error Logging**
- [ ] Add `error_log` list to Frenly
- [ ] Log all errors with timestamp and details
- [ ] Create `/api/frenly/errors` endpoint
- [ ] Test error logging

### **6.2 Graceful Degradation**
- [ ] If agent fails, mark as failed but continue operation
- [ ] Show warning in frontend when agents are down
- [ ] Allow mode changes even if some agents are down
- [ ] Test system behavior with failed agents

### **6.3 Error Recovery**
- [ ] Add "retry" button for failed agents

## 📝 **Implementation Notes**

### **File Structure**
```
forensic_reconciliation_app/ai_service/
├── agents/
│   ├── frenly_meta_agent.py          # Main agent (modify)
│   └── frenly_mcp_bridge.py          # MCP bridge (modify)
├── frenly_api.py                     # API endpoints (modify)
├── frenly_state.json                 # Saved state (new)
├── frenly_modes.json                 # Saved modes (new)
└── frontend/
    └── frenly_dashboard.html         # Simple dashboard (new)
```

### **Testing Strategy**
- Test each feature individually before moving to next
- Use simple test cases (change mode, check if saved)
- Test error scenarios (agent down, file missing)
- Test integration between components

### **Success Criteria**
- [ ] Frenly remembers state after restart
- [ ] Frontend shows real-time updates
- [ ] Agents can be monitored and restarted
- [ ] System works even if some agents fail
- [ ] All changes are logged and trackable

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Basic agent health
2. **Test thoroughly** before moving to next phase
3. **Keep it simple** - avoid over-engineering
4. **Focus on working features** rather than perfect code
5. **Document as you go** - don't leave it until the end

This simplified approach breaks down the complex synchronization into manageable, testable pieces that can be implemented incrementally.
