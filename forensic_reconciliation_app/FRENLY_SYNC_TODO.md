# 🚀 **FRENLY SYNCHRONIZATION TODO** 🚀

## 📋 **Overview**
This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for synchronizing Frenly meta-agent with the forensic reconciliation app. The approach is **incremental** and **testable** - each phase builds on the previous one.

## 🎯 **Implementation Status: COMPLETE** ✅

**All 35 todo items have been successfully implemented and tested!**

---

## 📋 **Phase 1: Basic Agent Health (Week 1) - ✅ COMPLETE**

### **1.1 Agent Heartbeat**
- [x] Add `is_alive` flag to agents
- [x] Create simple heartbeat check
- [x] Test with one agent
- [x] Test by manually marking an agent as failed

**💡 Recommendations:**
5. Use enum for agent status to prevent typos: `AgentStatus.ACTIVE`, `AgentStatus.FAILED`
6. Include failure reason in logs: "Agent X failed: Connection timeout"
7. Add failure timestamp for tracking how long agents have been down
8. Consider adding failure count to identify problematic agents

### **1.3 Simple Agent Recovery**
- [x] Add `restart_agent(agent_name)` function
- [x] Add retry counter (max 3 attempts)
- [x] Add 5-second delay between restart attempts
- [x] Test restart functionality

**💡 Recommendations:**
9. Use exponential backoff: 5s, 10s, 20s between retry attempts
10. Store retry count in agent status to prevent infinite loops
11. Log restart attempts for debugging: "Attempting to restart agent X (attempt 2/3)"
12. Consider adding manual override to force restart even if retry limit reached

## 📋 **Phase 2: State Saving (Week 2) - ✅ COMPLETE**

### **2.1 Save App Context to File**
- [x] Create `save_context_to_file()` function
- [x] Save current app context to `frenly_state.json`
